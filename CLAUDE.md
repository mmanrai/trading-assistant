# Advanced Trading Assistant PRD for Claude Code Implementation

## Executive Summary

**Building next-generation trading intelligence through AI-powered market analysis and real-time decision support.** This Product Requirements Document (PRD) leverages the Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) methodology specifically designed for Claude Code development, combining traditional business requirements with technical specifications optimized for AI-assisted implementation. The system will deliver institutional-grade trading capabilities through sophisticated pattern recognition, multi-timeframe analysis, risk management, and real-time market data integration using Quarkus MCP servers for bidirectional communication.

The trading assistant represents a convergence of modern financial technology and AI development practices, enabling retail and professional traders to access advanced analytical capabilities previously reserved for institutional trading desks. Through Claude Code's project-aware development environment and Quarkus MCP's reactive architecture, the system will achieve sub-millisecond response times while maintaining comprehensive risk controls and regulatory compliance.

## Interface Architecture and User Experience

### Claude Desktop as Primary Interface
